Stiegemeier used drawings of the shopping carts as an investigation of the homeless populations there. Cardboard, scavenged trash, sharpies and paint pens became the language for discussing those who inhabit these streets. As consumers we are encouraged to define our identities and self-worth through the objects we possess. As a society we take our means of survival for granted. Few of us stop to think about actual human needs, (our own, or others) and the complex and absurd strategy our society has developed to meet those needs.","bio":"Austin Stiegemeier grew up in Northern Idaho and was educated in the Northwest. He holds an M.F.A. from Washington State University in 2013. Austin's works focuses on people and their relationship to the modern social environment. As both a painter and printmaker he loves developing layers and uses a wide range of materials from traditional to experimental media including commercial vinyl sticker and scavenged cardboard and trash.

They introduced aluminum roofing nails, the shoal in a sea of pages, as the dissonant element. The conflict, as it were, in a story. Nails are fasteners; they are heavy, and they are dark.
